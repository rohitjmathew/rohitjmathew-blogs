True, swagger is a better way to help with API development. This is meant at organizations with very few processes in place to help better the development process. I would currently recommend starting with Postman and using it improve your development speed and then bring in better tools like Swagger to help make the process more refined and better.

Hope you agree with these views [Martin Borus](https://medium.com/u/f1f5cbcbc8de)
